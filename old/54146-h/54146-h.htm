<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The McGraw-Hill Book Company was formed on July 1,
1909, by a consolidation of the book departments of the McGraw
Publishing Company and the Hill Publishing Company, then
separate publishers of engineering journals and books. For over
twenty years, prior to the formation of the McGraw-Hill Book
Company, the several journals controlled by Mr. McGraw and
Mr. Hill (now published by the McGraw-Hill Company, Inc., a
separate organization) had been producing books in their special
fields; but the publication of technical books had not been brought
to the high standard of technical journals.</p>

<p>From the beginning we adopted the slogan, <i>Better Books in
Text and Manufacture</i>. It was evident to the men who had
brought the leading technical journals of the country from comparative
insignificance to positions of influence that there was need
of a new technical literature&mdash;a literature for classroom and
reference which should adequately supplement their periodicals.</p>

<p>Our first efforts were largely in the field of engineering, but
presently we set new goals for ourselves. By processes which
seemed natural to us, we have extended our publishing not only
into the fields of chemistry, physics, mathematics and English,
with a view always of supplying better fundamental textbooks
for students, but also into the fields of agriculture, business
administration and economics. Similarly our range of publishing
has broadened from the somewhat restricted field of <i>applied
science</i>, to include numerous works of high standard dealing with
<i>pure science</i>.</p>

<p>In all these fields the aim has been, not only to produce a
better grade of text and reference book, but to put behind each
book a selling organization so competent that the maximum
market, both in this country and abroad, would be reached.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>
Without this the possibility of persuading important men, in all
branches of science, to produce textbooks seemed futile, for the
author's return must always be in proportion to the distribution.</p>

<p>The association with the journals of the McGraw-Hill Company,
which we represent in all matters pertaining to the production
of books, brings us into close contact with the widest
range of engineering and industrial activities. The circulations
of these journals include the leading engineers and executives
of the world. The list follows:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>American Machinist</i></li>
<li><i>Electric Railway Journal</i></li>
<li><i>Electrical World</i></li>
<li><i>Engineering and Mining Journal-Press</i></li>
<li><i>Coal Age</i></li>
<li><i>Engineering News-Record</i></li>
<li><i>Power</i></li>
<li><i>Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering</i></li>
<li><i>Electrical Merchandising</i></li>
<li><i>Industrial Engineer</i></li>
<li><i>Bus Transportation</i></li>
<li><i>Journal of Electricity</i></li>
<li><i>Ingenieria Internacional</i></li>
</ul>

<p>From these journals we draw both editorial guidance and
marketing power. They are the "natural resources" which simplified
the problems of our early years and made possible our
rapid development and growth, until today, by the application
of the same editorial standards and marketing methods, in broader
fields, we are able to offer to the author of technical books a highly
developed machinery of publication and distribution.</p>

<h2>A FEW SUGGESTIONS TO<br />
McGRAW-HILL AUTHORS</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3>I<br /><br />

UNIFORMITY AND STANDARDS</h3></div>

<p>The purpose of these suggestions is fourfold:</p>

<blockquote><p>
(1) To assist our authors in preparing their manuscripts
and in understanding the general process of publication.</p>

<p>(2) To lighten the burden of the editors, typesetters, and
proof-readers in securing uniformity and adherence to
high standards.</p>

<p>(3)  To avoid complications and delays and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;the
item of author's corrections.</p>

<p>(4)  To obtain a standard of editorial details as uniformly
high as that of the subject-matter of our books.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Let it be understood, first of all, that these are suggestions,
not rules. Although we endeavor to maintain high standards,
we do not insist upon uniformity of style or consistency throughout
the books in our widely diversified list. The editor of a
periodical or the proceedings of a society properly insists upon
uniformity, generally issues a style sheet to guide his contributors,
and edits all manuscript to fixed standards. But since our books
cover nearly all branches of science, we feel that absolute uniformity
would accomplish no good purpose.</p>

<p>Throughout a single manuscript, however, in details of punctuation,
spelling, abbreviation, compounding of words, side- and
center-headings, notation, bibliographic references, etc., we do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
ask for the adoption of a conservative, well-recognized standard.
Even uniformity throughout a manuscript seems, curiously
enough, most difficult to secure, although the lack of it leads
to misunderstandings, delays and author's corrections, with their
attendant avoidable expenses.</p>

<p>We have used the phrase "conservative, well-recognized
standard" advisedly. Departure from such standards, either in
spelling, punctuation, systems of notation or otherwise, is not
advisable, for whatever convictions the author and the publisher
may have it is quite certain that the majority of the readers of any
given book will be conservative and more often annoyed than
otherwise by any radical departures from common practice.</p>

<p>Without reference to our own views on simplified spelling, for
example, we are confident that the radical simplified speller is
neither surprised nor disturbed to find in a book what he would
term old-fashioned spelling. The conservative speller, on the
other hand, is shocked even at <i>tho</i> and <i>thru</i>, and the book suffers
accordingly. Nevertheless, we have no quarrel with <i>sulfur</i> in our
manuscripts on chemical subjects, or with any other spelling
which has been approved officially by the leading technical
society in the particular field of the manuscript.</p>

<p>To secure consistency in details throughout his manuscript it is
best for an author to adopt as his guides, at the very beginning of
his work, some standard unabridged dictionary and an authoritative
writer's manual, and to stick to these alone until his book is on
the market. By this method he will give his book not only a high
standard but uniformity in details.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>II<br /><br />

PREPARING THE MANUSCRIPT</h3></div>

<p>The first requisite of good manuscript is obviously legibility.
To this end we suggest the following:</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Typing.</span>&mdash;Manuscript should be typewritten in black on one
side of white paper, uniform in size and preferably 8&frac12;&times;11 inches.
A paper of reasonable thickness and toughness is desirable. Thin,
"manifold" paper should not be used for the publisher's copy.</p>

<p>The same spacing should be used as far as practicable on each
sheet to facilitate estimates as to the number of words in the
complete manuscript. A margin of at least an inch should be left
at top, bottom, and left-hand side. Single spacing should be
avoided.</p>

<p>A carbon copy should invariably be made and retained by the
author, both for his reference and to protect him against possible
loss of the original. The original or ribbon copy should be sent
to the publisher.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Numbering the Pages.</span>&mdash;Sheets should be numbered consecutively
in the upper right-hand corner from beginning to end
and arranged in order of their numbers. Interpolated pages may
be marked 36a, 36b, and so forth, in accordance with the number
of the preceding page. If any pages are removed from the manuscript
for any reason, the preceding page should be double numbered,
as, for example: 36 &amp; 7 or 36-40.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Copy for Footnotes.</span>&mdash;Footnotes, if used, should be put into
the body of the manuscript immediately following the reference
and separated from the text by parallel lines above and below.
The number referring to the footnote should be placed in the text
and before the footnote. Generally speaking, we prefer the use of
arabic numerals for footnotes,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
which should be carried out consecutively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
through each chapter, when the footnotes are numerous,
with a new series for each chapter. In cases where footnotes are
relatively few, the numerals may be repeated without risk of confusion
from page to page as the footnotes occur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag1">1:</a>
This footnote is to show the size of type (8 point) which we generally
use for footnotes. Incidentally this booklet is set up in 10 point, and in the
general typographical style of our reference and textbooks, as distinguished
from handbooks. The dimensions of the type page and the trimmed size of
the page are those we usually adopt for the standard 6&times;9-inch book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="bhead">Copy for Illustrations.</span>&mdash;Drawings and photographs, which are
discussed more fully later, should not be inserted in the manuscript,
because illustrations are sent to the engraver at the same time
that the manuscript is sent to the printer. Small drawings should
be pasted on separate sheets of paper, one drawing to the sheet,
but large drawings and photographs should not be treated in this
manner. Mounted photographs are entirely satisfactory, but unmounted
photographs should not be pasted on sheets or mounted,
except by an expert. All illustrations should be referred to by
figure numbers in the text and numbered correspondingly for identification
on the copy. We prefer to have illustrations numbered
consecutively from the beginning to the end of the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Subdividing the Text.</span>&mdash;In modern textbooks and scientific
works the tendency is toward clearly marked subdivisions of the
text. To this end center-headings, side-headings, and subheadings
are constantly used. It is in general advisable that all manuscripts
be prepared in this way. As far as is possible the divisions
should be of reasonable length in order that the text may be
broken up sharply into its subdivisions. In the case of textbooks
intended for classroom use, we find that teachers generally prefer
divisions of approximately equal size and not over a page in length.
Where the division is longer than a page, subdivisions with side-headings
in italics may be used.</p>

<p>Bold-face headings may be indicated in the manuscript either
by the letters <span class="bhead">b. f.</span> or by underlining with a wavy line. Italics
may be indicated by underlining with a straight line. If bold-face
capitals are required, mark <span class="bhead">b. f. caps</span>.</p>

<p>In the designation of headings and subheadings particular care
should be taken to follow a consistent and easily understood plan.</p>

<p>Some of our editors strongly recommend that every chapter
should begin with an uncaptioned introductory paragraph to
avoid the bald-headed appearance that results if a chapter begins
immediately with a bold-face caption.</p>

<p>If a text is designed for one of the numerous series which we
publish, the author should consult the editor of the series for his
preference in this and similar matters.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span></p>

<p><span class="bhead">Some Details of Typography.</span>&mdash;For classroom use the majority
of teachers seem to prefer to have the side-headings numbered
consecutively throughout the book.</p>

<p>Tables and illustrations should be numbered consecutively
throughout the book but in separate series. Tables should have
an appropriate caption above, and, generally speaking, illustrations
should have a descriptive legend below. Tables should be
arranged, if possible, so that they can be printed across the page.</p>

<p>When equations and formulas are numerous, and especially in
books designed for classroom use, it is often advantageous to
number them consecutively throughout the text.</p>

<p>For chapters and tables roman numerals should be used; for
all other series, arabic.</p>

<p>Excerpts from the works of other authors (when they are more
than a phrase or sentence), problems, examples and test questions
are generally set in smaller type than the body of the text itself.
Accordingly they should be clearly marked.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Bibliographies.</span>&mdash;Bibliographic references by footnotes serve in
most books. Bibliographies of greater extent should be arranged
alphabetically at the end of each chapter of the book, or numbered
serially and referred to by numbers in the text. The custom is to
print the titles of books in roman and the titles of periodicals in
italics. Abbreviations should conform to the well-established
style sheets of technical societies. We recommend particularly
the abbreviations of:</p>

<p>The extent of the bibliography will vary, of course, with the
nature of the subject and the treatment. The tendency to-day
appears to be toward rather excessive bibliographies, which
do not seem to us generally to be justified. For a simple
rule, we recommend "bibliographies of easily accessible
sources."</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Tables of Contents.</span>&mdash;Detailed tables of contents to run in the
front of the book serve a useful purpose. They should, however,
be kept down to reasonable limits.</p>

<p>There are three forms of contents used in our books:</p>

<blockquote><p>
(1)  A simple list of chapter headings. In many cases this
is sufficient.</p>

<p>(2)  Chapter headings with all articles or sub-headings
given underneath. These may either be listed or "run
in." With a good index, such a full table of contents
seems hardly to serve a useful purpose.</p>

<p>(3)  The chapter headings with the outstanding sub-headings
listed or "run in" underneath. When these
headings are selected carefully they give a quick but
comprehensive picture of the contents.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lists of illustrations are nowadays generally regarded as
unnecessary in a technical book, and should be prepared only for
the guidance of the author and the publisher.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Indexes.</span>&mdash;A good subject index is necessary in all technical
works. A widely-read periodical in New York at one time published
regularly the following notice of subject books which were
submitted to it for review and found to be without indexes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The publisher and the author did not think well enough of this book to
supply it with a suitable index. We feel, therefore, that it is hardly worthy
of a review in our columns.
</p></blockquote>

<p>A good index is one which enables the reader or student to locate
readily the subject or item which he seeks. It is usually best
for an author to make his own index. A professional indexer is
inclined to overload an index; the author, with his knowledge of
the subject and a little study, will generally produce a better
working index.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Our usual style of index is two columns to the page, set in
8-point type, with not more than two indentions. The following
example shows the use of the single and double indentions:</p>

<p>Serious objection is properly made to numerous page references
under a single heading. For example, in a book on Petroleum,
references to every page on which the word <i>petroleum</i> appears
would obviously be valueless. The solution lies in concise qualifications
of the main titles to reduce to the minimum the actual
number of page references opposite each heading.</p>

<p>In the preparation of an index the use of 3&times;5-inch cards, or
paper of sufficient weight to be handled easily and of similar
dimensions, is advisable. This enables the author to arrange his
subject matter alphabetically and assemble his duplicate references
easily. The single and double indentions should be marked on
these cards, and the guide words stricken out when indentions are
indicated. For single indentions use this mark <span class="emph"><ins title="white square">&#9723;</ins></span>. For double
indentions use <span class="emph">&#9723;&#9723;</span>. If, after the cards are so arranged and
marked, it is possible for the author to have the index typewritten
in manuscript form, the risk of mixing and loss of cards is minimized
and the work of the printer is facilitated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span class="bhead">Some Details of Style.</span>&mdash;Because we do not seek uniformity
throughout our entire list of books but ask only for uniformity
within a manuscript itself, with adherence to any conservative and
well-recognized standard, we do not issue a style sheet.</p>

<p>The periodicals with which we are associated (the publications
of the McGraw-Hill Company, Inc., Tenth Avenue and 36th
Street, New York) have a sheet which is excellent, and which
may well serve as a guide to the author who is undertaking the
preparation of a manuscript. Or the author may use as his guide
any good writer's manual. At the risk of monotonous repetition,
however, we urge once more the importance of uniformity throughout
the manuscript itself. To this end, we suggest the following:</p>

<p><i>Spelling.</i>&mdash;Follow any one of the standard and well-recognized
dictionaries, but follow it consistently. We encounter difficulties
especially in the matter of hyphenated words; in using hyphens
follow the dictionary.</p>

<p><i>Abbreviations.</i>&mdash;Again, any well-recognized standard will satisfy
us. Dictionaries do not, in general, cover the abbreviations
of scientific words to a satisfactory extent. We would suggest,
therefore, that the author secure the style sheet of one of the
leading technical societies in the field in which he works.</p>

<p>All of these technical societies have not only worked out their
style sheets with care, but they have, in general, accustomed their
numerous members to the details of these style sheets.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Copyright Infringements.</span>&mdash;All publishers have noted in recent
years a great increase in the number of copyright infringement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
cases. Many of these appear to spring from the habit of first
preparing lecture notes, which are compiled or dictated from
various sources without thought of publication. By the time the
plan to produce a book matures, the source of the original material
is often entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>No question is more common in the technical publishing field
than "How far can I make excerpts, with credit but without
permission, from the writings of other authors?"</p>

<p>To this question no definite and entirely satisfactory answer
can be given. Certainly, where illustrations, tables, or important
abstracts are to be made, the author should ask permission of the
publisher or author from whose work he wishes to quote. In
addition he should take special pains to see that full credit is
given in the form required by the author or publisher from whom
he has secured permission.</p>

<p>The copyright law and the penalties for infringement of copyright
are drastic, but the decisions which have been rendered in
cases that have gone to trial do not furnish any particularly safe
guide.</p>

<p>In our experience the safest guide is a simple rule of courtesy.
Neither the author nor the publisher of a work will refuse any
reasonable request, though he may greatly resent borrowing
without the courtesy of a request. It is safer, therefore, to obtain
permission from author or publisher before borrowing from another
work.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Shipping the Manuscript.</span>&mdash;Manuscript should invariably be
shipped flat, not folded or rolled.</p>

<p>Manuscript and drawings should be sent together and not in
instalments. Except in rare instances, we do not undertake
piecemeal manufacture of a book. In our experience such publication
methods save little or no time and more often result in
confusion and expense.</p>

<p>Manuscript, before it has been set up in type, should be shipped
by express with a suitable valuation placed thereon. After the
manuscript has been set up in type, the manuscript and proof may
best be sent by parcel post, special delivery.</p>

<h3>III<br /><br />

ILLUSTRATIONS</h3></div>

<p>In technical work such as ours the illustrations are of two
classes: (1) line drawings; (2) photographic or halftone illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Line Drawings.</span>&mdash;Copy for line drawings should be made two
to three times the dimensions of the completed illustration. The
weight of line, and especially the lettering, should be carefully
worked out to give desired results. The following illustrations,
taken from "Engineering Drawing," by Thomas E. French, will
serve as a guide to the draftsman preparing these illustrations.
We suggest, however, that when the completed copy for a few
characteristic illustrations is ready, the author send the samples
to us in order that we may determine their suitability or even, if
desirable, reproduce the samples in order that the author may
examine the results with us. When difficulty is encountered in
securing suitable lettering, which will give a finished appearance
to the illustrations, we are willing to accept the drawings with the
lettering penciled in. We, in turn, engage draftsmen, who are
experienced in lettering for reproduction, to finish the work. As
this often leads to errors, however, we prefer the completed drawings
ready for reproduction.</p>

<p>Line drawings from periodicals, catalogues and other publications
can be reproduced direct without material reduction in size,
when the copy is suitable for the book, and, of course, when permission
to reproduce has been secured by the author.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Halftone Illustrations.</span>&mdash;Halftone illustrations can be made
satisfactorily only from photographs or wash drawings. Photographs
on a high-finish or glossy paper produce the best results.
We cannot produce good results by making a halftone from a
halftone print. A halftone engraving is photographed through
a screen, and when we undertake to reproduce a halftone from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
a halftone print we throw one screen upon the other. In rare
cases passable results can be obtained in this way, but such copy
should be used most sparingly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/011a-1000.png"><img src="images/011a-400.png" width="400" height="459" alt="Drawing for one-half reduction." /></a>
<p class="center">Drawing for one-half reduction.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/011b-500.png"><img src="images/011b-200.png" width="200" height="230" alt="One-half reduction." /></a>
<p class="center">One-half reduction.</p></div>

<p>If photographs are unmounted, they should not be mounted
or pasted on sheets of paper. Smoothly mounted photographs
present no difficulties to the engraver.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Numbers, letters or marks should not be placed on the face
of photographic prints or wash drawings. If numbers or letters
are called for, they should be indicated in pencil at the proper
point on the back of unmounted prints. This can be done easily
by holding the print against a window facing a strong light. In
the case of mounted photographs, a fly leaf of thin paper pasted
on the back of the photograph at the top and folded over the face
of the photograph, can be used for the numbers or letters. In both
cases the engraver adds the numbers or letters on the print in the
manner best suited to reproduction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/012a-1200.png"><img src="images/012a-600.png" width="600" height="402" alt="Drawing for two-thirds reduction." /></a>
<p class="center">Drawing for two-thirds reduction.</p></div>

<p class="center">Two-thirds reduction.</p></div>

<p>Manufacturers' cuts can sometimes be used when the nature
of the text calls for them. If possible the manufacturer should
be asked to supply the original photograph or drawing. If this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
not available, then the original cut&mdash;not an electrotype&mdash;should
be secured. Electrotypes can often be used, but the results are
not of the standard which we like to maintain.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Wax Cuts.</span>&mdash;Formerly many textbooks were illustrated by
engravings made by the wax process. This is the process ordinarily
used for the production of maps. The cost of these engravings
has risen, however, to a point which makes them now practically
out of the question for the average book. They may be used in
special cases. Their chief advantage is that they can be made
from rough pen or pencil sketches and do not call either for finished
lines or careful lettering.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">In General.</span>&mdash;Wherever possible illustrations to occupy a full
page should stand vertically on the page. This is, we think, obviously
more satisfactory to the user of the book.</p>

<p>Folded plates and charts should be avoided as far as possible,
not only because they involve an unreasonable expense, but
because American readers, at least, do not like them. Furthermore
any considerable number of inserted charts weakens the
binding of the book.</p>

<p>Color plates and maps in color are prohibitively expensive for
most technical books, but systems of shading and cross-hatching
can be employed as a substitute for colors in many forms of illustration.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">The Number of Illustrations.</span>&mdash;The cost of engravings of all
types has risen out of all proportion to the costs of other details
of book manufacture, and there is no present prospect of a
reduction in the scale of prices. This proves to be especially
burdensome to the publishers of technical and scientific books
where the texts generally contain a large number of illustrations.
Accordingly we ask authors to consider carefully the possibilities
of reducing the number of illustrations. In books of the character
of ours illustrations are essential, and wherever they aid the reader
in grasping the subject or are essential to the understanding of the
subject, they cannot be eliminated. But we do not believe in
illustrations that are merely "pictures" and are not essential
to the understanding of the text. Wherever they can be dispensed
with, without injury to the text, they should be eliminated
in order that the retail price of the book may be kept within
reasonable limits.</p>

<h3>IV<br /><br />

MANUFACTURING THE BOOK</h3></div>

<p><span class="bhead">Sample Galleys.</span>&mdash;When the manuscript has been prepared
in our offices for the printer, and the time has come to undertake
the manufacture of the book, we ask the printer, first, to set a few
pages of the manuscript and submit them to us in galley proofs.
These are in turn submitted to the author in order that he may
study the typography and inform us if we have in any way misunderstood
his manuscript and the marks on it. This step is, of
course, dispensed with if a definite agreement has been reached
in advance as to the typographical details of the book.</p>

<p>When the author has looked over these first galleys, not with
the idea of proof-reading but of determining upon the style, we
instruct the printer to proceed with the typesetting.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Galley Proofs.</span>&mdash;These proofs in duplicate (one set is for the
author's files) are first submitted to the author, and accompanying
these is a cut dummy which shows the illustrations reproduced
as they will appear in the book.</p>

<p>Galley proofs should be read with extreme care, and wherever
possible the author should call in some associate or assistant to
read them as well, for it is our experience that the author who has
spent a great deal of time in the preparation of a manuscript often
reads with his memory rather than his eyes and passes the most
obvious errors.</p>

<p>When the author returns the galleys with his corrections marked
thereon, he should at the same time return the original manuscript.
At this time also figure numbers and captions should be
added to the illustrations, and an indication should be made by
number in the margin of the galleys of the approximate location
of the illustrations.</p>

<p>Illustrations are inserted in the pages by the printer as near
the point of reference as the limitations of make-up will permit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
If, as happens in rare cases, an illustration must be inserted in
a given paragraph, this should be clearly indicated on the galley
proof.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Page Proofs.</span>&mdash;The printer then proceeds to make the book up
into pages, and duplicate page proofs are forwarded to the author.
These again should be read carefully to make sure that all corrections
which were indicated in the galleys have been properly made,
and returned to us for final casting into plates. Changes, and
additions other than typographical corrections, which involve the
overrunning and rearranging of lines or pages, often mean the
remake-up of many pages of type and an expense that is usually
out of all proportion to the good accomplished. Corrections and
changes should, therefore, always be made in the galley proofs,
to avoid the difficult question of author's corrections, which is
discussed on page 18.</p>

<p>The duplicate set of page proofs should be retained by the
author for use in preparing his index, in order that the copy for
the index may be forwarded as soon after the final shipment of
page proofs as possible.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Answering Queries.</span>&mdash;Frequently the proof-readers query
certain points in the manuscript on the galley or page proofs. It
is important that the author note these queries in all cases and
indicate his decision regarding the questions so raised.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Proof-reading.</span>&mdash;In technical books especially, good proof-reading
is essential. We use every effort to submit proofs which
follow closely the original copy, but the experienced author knows
that he himself cannot exercise too much care in proof-reading.
The amount of damage which has been done to the reputation
and sales of many otherwise excellent technical books, by carelessness
in proof-reading, would astound the inexperienced author.</p>

<p>One set of galley and one set of page proofs which the author
receives are marked with the printer's corrections, generally in
green or red ink. The set containing the printer's marks should
be returned with the author's corrections added. The duplicate
set the author should keep for his own files.</p>

<p>For the guidance of those who are inexperienced in proof-reading,
we give herewith a reproduction of a sheet showing the
ordinary proof-reading marks. It is helpful if the author follows
this general system in marking his proofs. It is essential that the
corrections be clearly marked.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Author's Corrections.</span>&mdash;No problem in the publishing of technical
books gives the publisher and the author more trouble than
the question of author's corrections. The term "author's corrections"
covers, technically, changes made in content, arrangement
or typographical style, or additions to the manuscript, after
the type has been set.</p>

<p>The publisher, to protect himself against the author who
practically rewrites his manuscript after it has been set up in type,
usually provides in his contract that corrections in excess of a
certain percentage of the cost of composition shall be charged to
and paid for by the author. The printer makes a careful distinction
between printer's corrections and author's corrections.
Corrections marked in galley and page proofs of a book where the
printer has not followed copy are printer's corrections. Author's
corrections are changes and additions made in the proof. Obviously,
where these changes make a distinct improvement in the
text&mdash;that is, a better book&mdash;the publisher takes a sympathetic
attitude; but when the item of author's corrections runs to a total
of twenty-five or fifty per cent or more of the cost of setting up
the book, there is clear indication that the author did not complete
his book in the manuscript but in the proof.</p>

<p>For a general rule it should be kept in mind that corrections
in the galley proofs cost much less than corrections in the page
proofs where remake-up of pages involving a large expense may
result from the addition of a single line, or even a few words.
But it is most important of all for the author to realize that every
correction made after the manuscript has been set up in type is
time-consuming and expensive, and that such delay and expense
are reduced to a minimum when the author submits a clean, carefully
prepared manuscript which embodies his final judgment of
content and style.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>V<br /><br />

WHEN THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED</h3></div>

<p>Within a short period after the author returns the proofs of
the index, the book is ready for publication. The author's work
is then practically done.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the arrival of the bound books from the
bindery, the publisher places the work upon the market, copyrights
it in this country and abroad, and undertakes campaigns
for its distribution.</p>

<p>This section of the <i>Suggestions</i> is intended to show the author
how he can help in this work and to answer certain questions
which are asked constantly.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Marketing a Book.</span>&mdash;We take pride in the thoroughness with
which we seek the market for all books bearing our imprint. The
spirit of the agreement which we make with the author is that
each book is a separate business venture into which we have
entered as a partner of the author.</p>

<p>In marketing his book the author can be of material assistance
to us. He knows the subject better than we can ever know it,
and he knows the type of man to which he intends his book to
appeal. For these reasons we always welcome the assistance and
suggestions of the author.</p>

<p>At the time when the author begins to receive page proofs
of the book, we are outlining our campaign for its distribution.
At that time we like to receive from the author, first, a brief but
exact definition of the scope and purpose of the book. This
we use, not for our advertising, but as the basis of our advertising.
Second, we find distinctly helpful a list of points to emphasize in
our circular and periodical advertising, and for such a list we
look to the author. A cut-and-dried table of contents often fails
to give as good a picture of a book as do a few well-selected points.</p>

<p>At the same time the author's suggestions of special periodicals
to which copies should be sent for review, and of special lists which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
may well be circularized, will also be helpful. These we generally
know about, but sometimes we overlook obvious points of attack
in our campaigns.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Corrections and Revisions.</span>&mdash;In practically every instance our
books are printed from electrotype plates. Consequently the first
printings are rarely large, because we are able to produce further
copies, from our electrotype plates, as needed.</p>

<p>Before a book is reprinted the author is given an opportunity
to send in corrections of typographical and other errors which have
escaped notice in the earlier printing or printings. Such reprints,
however, are not called new editions nor is the title page date of
the book changed. We follow strictly the policy of designating
as new editions only books which have been more or less thoroughly
revised, and the title page date of one of our books is an indication
of the date of the text&mdash;not of the reprint.</p>

<p>When, in the author's opinion or our own, the text requires
revision, we discuss the details with the author and arrange for as
complete a revision as the condition of the text calls for. Since
the printings of our books are rarely large, we are able to arrange
for the production of a new edition in normal cases as soon as the
author feels that it is required and can complete his portion of the
work.</p>

<p><span class="bhead">Translations.</span>&mdash;We arrange, where possible, for translations of
books into foreign languages, dividing the proceeds with the
author. The underlying theory of this division is that, with the
publication of a translation, both the author and the publisher
suffer from the loss of sales of the edition in English.</p>

<p>The foreign publisher generally has to pay to his translator
about the royalties usually paid to an author, and accordingly the
amount which can be charged to a foreign publisher for rights of
translation is, except in rare cases, small. Translations must be
regarded as a by-product.</p>

<p>Our attempts to market books in foreign languages from New
York, or from one of our foreign agencies, have not been encouraging.
Accordingly, the first question, when we are endeavoring to
arrange for a translation, is for us to find a publisher in the country
selected who will undertake the work of securing a translator and
publishing the book. When a translator offers his services, we
find it necessary to ask him first to interest a publisher in his own
country in the venture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span></p>

<p><span class="bhead">Prompt Publication.</span>&mdash;From the standpoint of both the author
and the publisher it is desirable that a book should be put on the
market as soon as possible after the manuscript is completed.</p>

<p>From the moment the publisher undertakes to manufacture
a book he has an investment which grows rapidly and yields
nothing until the sales of the book begin.</p>

<p>The production of technical books is delayed, generally, by one
of the following causes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
(1) The author wishes to submit his material to his associates
or to specialists in the field. Except for purposes
of proof-reading such submission should be made
in manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The author fails to return his proofs and manuscript
copy promptly. The prompt reading and return of
proofs is of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>(3) The copy for the index does not follow closely upon the
return of the final batch of page proofs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The printer, the engraver, the paper manufacturer, the binder
or the publisher may also interfere with prompt publication; but if
the author's end of the work is handled systematically and
promptly, we are generally able to control the manufacturing
details.</p>

<h4>Transcriber's Note</h4>

<p>Sundry missing or damaged punctuation has been repaired.</p>

<p>Page 6, etc.: 'sub-headings', and 'subheadings' both appear in this book, as do 'proof-reader' and 'proofreader',
and some other instances of hyphenated and non-hyphenated words.</p>

<p>As it is a book of suggestions on layout and style from a respected publishing house,
it can be assumed they knew what they intended, so both hyphenated and non-hyphenated words have been retained.</p>

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
